This folder contains the measurements of the turn-on und off behavior of the highside switch with and without a RC-snubber circuit.

Settling time of the thermocouple amplifier output in the heating pause is about 1.8 ms (without picture). The settling time is taken into account in the source code with a heating pause before the measurement.
